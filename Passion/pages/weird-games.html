                        <p id="descrip">in this game, you spend your time talking to a human-fish<br>
                        hybrid via microphone, that has a very snarky personality. the microphone isnt<br>
                        isn't all that good but if the microphone works, the seaman surprisingly responds.<br>
                        the creature throughout the game evolves into weird strange forms based on its age.<br>
                        this might be the strangest one on the list honestly.</p>

                        <p id="descrip">this is an exploration game that has a strange cast of characters.<br>
                        the world is very strange, everyone almost looks like they're in their own art style.<br>
                        and with that, comes different personalities. i don't think there's much of a dull moment<br>
                        in this game.</p>

                        the experience is short-lived, but the team behind this game had some strange ideas for<br>
                        the game. the most memorable thing about this game would be the popular<br>
